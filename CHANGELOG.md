  - Buries new cards already in today's queue (fixes cards appearing even after blocking)

### Changed

- Added `bury_new_cards_in_queue()`: Buries new cards already scheduled for today
- Added `unbury_new_cards()`: Unburied cards on weekdays

### Technical Details
- Cards are now buried using `mw.col.sched.bury_cards()` to hide them from today's queue
