## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length: 100 characters (soft limit)
- Use docstrings for all public functions

**Example:**
```python
def calculate_weekend_dates(weeks_ahead: int) -> List[datetime.date]:
    """
    Calculate weekend dates for the specified number of weeks ahead.

    Args:
        weeks_ahead: Number of weeks to calculate

    Returns:
        List of weekend dates (Saturdays and Sundays)
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### File Organization

- Keep files focused and modular
- Separate UI code from business logic
- Use utility functions for common operations
- Avoid circular imports

### Error Handling

- Use try-except blocks for operations that might fail
- Log errors appropriately
- Provide helpful error messages to users
- Don't catch generic exceptions unless necessary

**Example:**
```python
try:
    config = get_addon_config()
except Exception as e:
    log_action("Error loading config", {"error": str(e)})
    show_warning("Could not load configuration. Using defaults.")
    config = get_default_config()
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Checklist

Before submitting, test:

- [ ] Fresh installation on test profile
- [ ] Weekend detection (Saturday/Sunday)
- [ ] Weekday detection (Monday-Friday)
- [ ] Manual pause/resume
- [ ] Enable/disable addon
- [ ] Restore original settings
- [ ] Multiple deck configurations
- [ ] AnkiWeb sync behavior
- [ ] Menu updates dynamically
- [ ] Status display is accurate
- [ ] All error scenarios

### Test Cases to Consider

1. **Edge Cases**
   - Empty deck
   - Deck with 0 new cards configured
   - Addon disabled
   - Manual pause active
   - No original_limits saved

2. **User Workflows**
   - Normal weekly usage
   - Vacation mode activation/deactivation
   - Configuration restore
   - First-time setup

3. **Platform-Specific**
   - Different Anki versions
   - Different operating systems
   - Different timezone scenarios
