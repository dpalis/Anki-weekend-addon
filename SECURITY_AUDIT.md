## Audit Checklist

### ✅ Network Security
- ❌ **No external network requests**: Code does not make any HTTP/HTTPS requests
- ❌ **No data transmission**: No data is sent to external servers
- ❌ **No third-party APIs**: Does not connect to any external services
- ✅ **Offline-only operation**: All functionality is local

**Status**: SAFE ✅

### ✅ Data Privacy
- ❌ **No personal data collection**: Does not collect or store personal information
- ❌ **No telemetry**: No usage statistics or analytics
- ❌ **No tracking**: No user tracking mechanisms
- ✅ **Local data only**: All data remains on user's device
- ✅ **AnkiWeb sync only**: Uses Anki's built-in sync (not addon-initiated)

**Status**: SAFE ✅

### ✅ File System Security
- ✅ **Limited file access**: Only reads/writes to addon's own directory
- ✅ **Safe file operations**: Uses `open()` only for append-only logging
- ✅ **No arbitrary file access**: No user-controlled file paths
- ✅ **No file deletion**: Does not delete user files
- ❌ **No system file access**: Does not touch system files

**Status**: SAFE ✅

### ✅ Code Execution Security
- ❌ **No eval()**: Does not use `eval()`
- ❌ **No exec()**: Does not use `exec()`
- ❌ **No __import__**: Does not dynamically import modules
- ❌ **No subprocess**: Does not spawn system processes
- ✅ **No command injection**: No shell command execution

**Status**: SAFE ✅

### ✅ Database Security
- ✅ **Uses Anki API**: Only uses official Anki collection methods
- ❌ **No raw SQL**: Does not execute raw SQL queries
- ❌ **No SQL injection**: No SQL-related vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Safe data access**: Only modifies deck configuration, not card data

**Status**: SAFE ✅

### ✅ Input Validation
- ✅ **No user input for file paths**: All paths are predetermined
- ✅ **Config validation**: Configuration is read from trusted source (Anki's config system)
- ✅ **Type safety**: Uses type hints throughout
- ✅ **No string interpolation from user input**: No user-controlled strings in sensitive operations

**Status**: SAFE ✅

### ✅ Dependency Security
- ✅ **Minimal dependencies**: Only uses Anki's built-in libraries
- ❌ **No external packages**: Does not require pip packages
- ✅ **Standard library only**: Uses only Python standard library + Anki API

**Status**: SAFE ✅

### ✅ Permissions
- ✅ **Minimal permissions**: Only requests what's necessary
- ✅ **No elevated privileges**: Does not require admin/root
- ✅ **Sandboxed**: Operates within Anki's addon sandbox

**Status**: SAFE ✅

## Code Review Findings

### File: `utils.py`
- ✅ Uses `os.path` safely for path manipulation
- ✅ File writing is append-only and exception-handled
- ✅ No user input in file paths
- ✅ Encoding specified (`utf-8`) for all file operations

### File: `core.py`
- ✅ Uses Anki's official API methods only
- ✅ No direct database access
- ✅ Configuration changes are reversible
- ✅ Saves backup before making changes

### File: `ui.py`
- ✅ User confirmations before destructive actions
- ✅ Clear messaging about what each action does
- ✅ No user input validation needed (uses buttons/menus only)

### File: `__init__.py`
- ✅ Exception handling in place
- ✅ Graceful degradation if errors occur
- ✅ Does not crash Anki on failure

## Potential Concerns & Mitigations

### Concern 1: Log File Growth
**Issue**: `actions.log` could grow unbounded over time
**Severity**: Low (cosmetic only)
**Impact**: Disk space usage
**Mitigation**: Consider adding log rotation in future version
**Current Status**: Acceptable for v1.0

### Concern 2: Config Backup
**Issue**: `original_limits` is stored in config and never updated
**Severity**: Low
**Impact**: If user manually changes deck settings, backup becomes stale
**Mitigation**: User can manually restore via Anki's deck options
**Current Status**: Acceptable, documented in README

---

## Privacy Analysis

### Data Collected
**NONE** - The addon does not collect any data.

### Data Stored Locally
- ✅ Deck configuration backups (in addon config)
- ✅ Action logs (timestamps and actions taken)
- ✅ User preferences (enabled/disabled state)

**All local, no transmission**

### Data Shared
**NONE** - No data leaves the user's device via the addon.

**Note**: Deck configuration changes sync via Anki's built-in AnkiWeb sync, which is initiated by the user, not the addon.

---

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
✅ **Compliant** - No personal data processing

### CCPA Compliance
✅ **Compliant** - No personal information collection

### Open Source License
✅ **MIT License** - Compatible with Anki's licensing

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Public Release
- [x] Code security audit
- [ ] Test on fresh Anki installation
- [ ] Test with multiple deck configurations
- [ ] Test error handling (corrupt config, missing permissions)
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (Mac, Windows, Linux)
- [ ] Test AnkiWeb sync behavior

### Post-Release Monitoring
- Monitor GitHub issues for unexpected behavior
- Watch for reports of data loss (should be impossible, but monitor anyway)
- Check for compatibility issues with other addons

---

## Recommendations for Future Versions

### Security Enhancements
1. Add log rotation to prevent unbounded log growth
2. Add config validation on load
3. Consider cryptographic signing of configs (if paranoid)

### Code Quality
1. Add unit tests
2. Add integration tests
3. Consider type checking with mypy

### Documentation
1. Add security policy (SECURITY.md)
2. Document threat model
3. Add responsible disclosure guidelines

## Conclusion

✅ **The Weekend Blocker addon is SAFE for public release.**

The code follows security best practices and does not exhibit any of the common vulnerability patterns found in malicious software. It respects user privacy, operates entirely offline, and only modifies non-critical configuration settings that can be easily restored.

**Recommendation**: APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE
